## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on more advanced SQL queries and database management using MySQL 8.0. You will learn how to manage users and permissions, use constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`), and write more complex queries involving `JOIN`, `UNION`, and subqueries.

- What is a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `FOREIGN KEY`
- How to use `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints
- How to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query
- How to write subqueries
- How to use `JOIN` and `UNION`
